## Coding Etiquette

The following rules should be upheld at all times when coding or working in this repo:
1. Include informative comments throughout your code, using the double hashtag (`##`) symbol.
2. Comment out lines of code using a singlular hashtag (`#`) symbol
3. Space out your code to make it easier to read (putting spaces between operators).
4. Give informative names to all of your objects.
5. Keep your code to under 80 characters in length per line to avoid text travelling off screen (add guidance line as reference).
6. When naming folders, keep all text lowercase and use a dash (`-`) instead of spaces. i.e. “meds-courses”
7. When naming files, keep all text lowercase and use a underscore (`_`) instead of spaces. i.e. “sb_water_2022”

#### Have a Great Day!
